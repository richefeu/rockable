    @brief   Based on the default law, this law is designed for slow landslides.
             It includes Linear normal repulsion, normal viscosity, 'Coulomb-like' viscuous Friction, 
             and moment resistance. The specific feature is to make the friction force viscuous while still using 
             the Coulomb cone yielding.
    @return  Return true if the interaction is active (ie. with a non-zero force)
