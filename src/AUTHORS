The code was initially developed by *Vincent Richefeu*, at Laboratoire 3SR, to model rockfalls and rock avalanches. This has been done through The PhD work of *Stiven Cuervo* and *Bruna Garcia*, but it actually started before in a code named ``DEMbox`` (no longer maintained).

Then, the breakable interfaces have been implemented during the PhD work of *Marta Stasiak*. A number of improvements have been added at that time thanks to intensive review with *Gael Combe*, Laboratoire 3SR.

New functionalities are being studied thanks to new collaborations of people from CEA, IATE and CNRS. For example,
*Lhassan Amarsid* (CEA) is working on the introduction of periodic boundary conditions, and multi-processor 
computing with domain decomposition. *Farhang Radjai* and students, may introduce new breakable interfaces 
with energy-based criteria.
